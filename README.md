#How do I approach designing software?
#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
#What design process did you follow for your project work?
#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
#I approach designing software in using the SDLC framework.  Identifying the issue to be solved or the goal of the program, brainstorming different methods of potential solutions, deciding on a method and building the method, then testing and adjusting as needed.

#How do I approach developing programs?
#What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
#How did iteration factor into your development?
#How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
#As I was developing through milestones, it became clear that build a strong foundation for the program and continuing to work on a strong foundation of well spaced and            commented code was the key to ensure the program remained functional when new functions and features such as lighting and textures were added.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
#Computational graphics and visualization help can be applied to both my educational and professional pathway in that, it has helped me understand modularity by loading and integrating different libraries, and how to generate 2D and 3D images that can be used to generate models and graphs for information communication.
